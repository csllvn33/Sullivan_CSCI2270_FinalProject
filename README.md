# Sullivan_CSCI2270_FinalProject


Project summary:
For our final project, my code will read in a list of supplements (as in protein, vitamins, fat burners, etc) from a file and sort them in a Binary Search Tree. The tree will be sorted by user review rating from bodybuilding.com. The products will be top products purchased (top products may not have the highest ratings).

Dependencies:
the file "supplements.txt" will be read in.

System requirements:
I write and run code on a windows, however OS should not be a specific factor.

Group members:
me, myself, and I.
