# Sullivan_CSCI2270_FinalProject


Project summary:
For our final project, my code will read in a list of supplements (as in protein, vitamins, fat burners, etc) from a file and sort them in a Binary Search Tree. The tree will be sorted by user review rating from bodybuilding.com. The products will be top products purchased (top products may not have the highest ratings).

Dependencies:
the file "supplements.txt" will be read in.
when executing code, type : ./a.out supplements.txt

System requirements:
I write and run code on a windows, however OS should not be a specific factor.

Group members:
me, myself, and I.

Contributors:
None as of 16 April 2015

Open Isuues/Bugs:
Seg fault when user wants "6". From print statements, the code breaks on the if statement on line 643. 

***Also, I apologize for all of my commit activity to be on 4/26/2015 as I am finally figuring out how to maneuver Github (somewhat) successfully.
